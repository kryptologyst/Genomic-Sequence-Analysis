2. **NOT MEDICAL ADVICE**: The outputs of this software do not constitute medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment recommendations.

3. **RESEARCH DEMONSTRATION**: This is a demonstration tool showcasing machine learning techniques for genomic sequence analysis. It is not validated for clinical applications.

4. **SYNTHETIC DATA**: The included datasets are synthetic and generated for demonstration purposes. They do not represent real genomic data or clinical scenarios.

### Professional Medical Advice Required

- **ALWAYS CONSULT QUALIFIED HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS** for any medical decisions or interpretations of genomic data.
- **CLINICAL VALIDATION REQUIRED**: Any application to real clinical data requires appropriate validation and regulatory approval.
- **SUPERVISION NECESSARY**: Use of this software should be supervised by qualified professionals with appropriate expertise.

### Model Limitations

1. **PERFORMANCE**: Model performance on synthetic data may not reflect real-world clinical performance.
2. **GENERALIZATION**: Models may not generalize to different populations, sequencing technologies, or genomic contexts.
3. **BIAS**: Models may contain biases that are not apparent in synthetic data.
4. **UNCERTAINTY**: Prediction confidence scores should not be interpreted as clinical certainty.

### Data Privacy and Security

1. **NO PHI/PII**: This software does not handle Protected Health Information (PHI) or Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
2. **LOCAL PROCESSING**: All data processing occurs locally on your system.
3. **NO DATA TRANSMISSION**: No genomic or personal data is transmitted to external servers.

### Regulatory Considerations
